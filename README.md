# Robotics-Assignment
My robotics assignment which has to have a manipulator and mobile robot working together

# How to Use
Open the html file. Press "G" to start. The manipulator tracks the position of the mobile robot using feedback control. Press "Space" to reset.

The red blocks are obstacles. The green line is the path the robot will take, determined by an implemenation of the Dijkstra's algorithm between 2 predetermined points.
